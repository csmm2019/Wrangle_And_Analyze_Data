Wangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. 

The dataset that will be wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) in this porject is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
